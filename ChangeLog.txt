WPF TextRun

[Issue]
-- If you are just on the caret, drag mouse, you can not select any text.
-- single click to cancel text selection
-- Direction Up/Down can remember last two line position, like other text editor.
-- In wrap, type space in the beginning of a TextLine only add space to the previous TextLine. 
   AvalonEdit and WPS have the same issue but notepad++ hasn't.
-- //bug: why we must + 1.0, otherwise, a slight gap between lines.
